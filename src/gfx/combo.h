// A combo box: a closed control showing the current item, and a popup list to change it.
//
// Adapted from simple-login-gui's gfx/menu.{h,cpp}, which is the only popup in this family of
// projects. What carries over is everything that makes a popup behave -- anchor-relative
// placement that flips and then clamps, two independent cursors for pointer and keyboard, modal
// key swallowing, and a click outside that closes AND IS SWALLOWED so a mis-aimed dismissal does
// not also press whatever was underneath it.
//
// What is dropped: that menu's two-click confirmation for destructive rows, which exists because
// one of its rows powers the machine off. Nothing in this window is destructive.
//
// What is added: a tick against the current item, which is the whole difference between a menu
// (a list of actions) and a combo box (a choice with a current value).
//
// PLACEMENT PREFERS BELOW, not above. The login screen's menu opens upward because its button is
// in the panel's bottom row; both combos here sit in the upper half of a short window, so down is
// the natural direction and up is the fallback.
