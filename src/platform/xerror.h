// Non-fatal X error handling.
//
// Xlib's default error handler calls exit(). One BadWindow -- a window manager racing us on
// shutdown, a stale resource id -- would therefore take the process down mid-session, and this
// process is holding a pipe whose closure restores the machine. Ending abruptly is not a
// correctness problem here (the helper restores on EOF either way, by design), but it is a
// terrible way to find out about a recoverable error, and it loses the diagnostic.
//
// Ported from the rations-amp plug-in's x11plugview.cpp, where it exists because a plug-in that
// calls exit() takes the HOST down with it. The mechanism is the same; only the stakes differ.
//
// Errors on a display that is not ours are forwarded to whatever handler was installed before, so
// this never swallows another library's diagnostics.
